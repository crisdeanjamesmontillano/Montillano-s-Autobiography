I do not know as of now. I am aware it is strange considering I am now getting old, although, I do know that I will pick something that I will enjoy in the future, no matter how hard or "maybe" underpaid that job is. As long as I enjoyed doing the things I do appreciate, I will pursue that. <P>

That is all. Thank you for listening. <BR>
